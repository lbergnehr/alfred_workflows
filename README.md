# Alfred Workflows

## Insert character

The *Insert Character* workflow helps you find and insert unicode characters into your text. With Alfred open, type the keyword (defaults to `insert`) followed by the name of the character. A list of characters matching the name will appear in the list. Pressing enter on a selected item will copy it to the clipbard as well as insert the character.
